# To Run the Function
Inside `StringSort.ts` are two method invocations where each function is called with an input. If you'd like to test the functions you can either change the input here or put it as test cases, as mentioned below.
```bash
cd src
tsc StringSort.ts
node StringSort.js
```

# To Run the test file
```bash
cd tests
npx jest
```
